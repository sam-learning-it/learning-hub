### How Statistics Helps in Machine Learning

Statistics plays a key role in machine learning. It helps in understanding data, identifying patterns, and making informed decisions based on that data. Whether building predictive models or analyzing results, statistical methods provide the foundation for accuracy and reliability.

In machine learning workflows, statistics is used to connect raw data to meaningful insights. This ensures that outcomes are driven by evidence and not assumptions.

There are two main types of statistical tools commonly used:

1. __Descriptive statistics__: Used to identify important elements in a dataset, summarize, and quantify the data (e.g., mean, mode, median, range, interquartile range, variance).
2. __Inferential statistics__: Used to explain the important elements identified via relationships with other elements (e.g., hypothesis testing, data modeling).
