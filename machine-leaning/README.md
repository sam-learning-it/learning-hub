## Introduction
At its core, a machine learning model is built using an algorithm that learns from data. This algorithm can parse an input dataset, find patterns, and use these patterns to make predictions. Machine learning algorithms are designed to handle vast amounts of data, often involving millions of records, and can make intelligent decisions based on the patterns they identify.

For example, a machine learning algorithm can analyze emails on a server to determine whether they are spam or legitimate (ham). Another example is image recognition, where the algorithm identifies edges, colors, and shapes in images to determine if the image is of a girl, bird, or cat.

Machine learning is a constantly evolving field, with new types of algorithms being developed regularly, such as reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks.
